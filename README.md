* support to connect over cloud to the device in all situations
* support to connect locally to the device in all situations

* It shows the problems that the device is reporting like wifi error log, ocpp error log, cloud error log
* It shows any network communication problems like invalid websocket response received
* Support for all future compatible products as it does not hardcode any device types (Therefore it also works with dereived products)
